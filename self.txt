I like doing backend jobs, I am familiar with Python Django Framework, and a little bit of Angular JS Framework. I like to prepare the data needed to cooperate with the front end, and fix bugs. I am willing to accept new challenges.

I am currently studying in TARUMT Year 3, I seeking an internship or full-time job, my internship starts in November 2023 until 2024. (6 months) After the internship direct graduate so I i hope can find a company that can provide a full-time job opportunity.

To perform the requested action, WordPress needs to access your web server. Please enter your FTP credentials to proceed. All you have to do is add the following line to your wp-config.php file which gives WordPress permission to directly access filesystem to add and remove plugins and other content:

Cd var/www/html
nano wp-config.php

define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );


Then save
If using vim wp-config.php then 
:wq 




Other
sudo chown -Rf www-data.www-data /var/www/html/
